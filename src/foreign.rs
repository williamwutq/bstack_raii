//! [`Foreign<T>`]: a cross-file pointer — "a slice with a file identity attached".
//!
//! An in-file reference stores just a `u64` offset (length recovered from
//! `size_of::<T::OnDisk>()`). A `Foreign<T>` widens that with the target file's
//! identity: on disk it is an inert wire record `{ file_id: u64, address: u64 }` (16
//! bytes, `Pod`) — length is still recovered from the type, so it is *not* stored.
//! Dereferencing resolves `file_id` through the process-wide
//! [registry](crate::registry) to the file's live allocator, then reads/writes at
//! `offset` in that file.
//!
//! As a `#[bstack_block]` field, a `Foreign<T>` carries the same ownership
//! annotations as an in-file field — `#[bstack_owned/strong/weak/ref]` (or none) —
//! but applied to the target `T` **in its own file**: an owning foreign pointer
//! frees / decrements / releases the target *on the other side* at teardown, and a
//! deep clone copies (owned) or re-references (strong/weak) it across files. Those
//! cross-file **teardown** ([`foreign_drop_owned`]/`_strong`/`_weak`) and **deep
//! clone** ([`foreign_clone_owned`]/`_strong`/`_weak`) dispatches run the ordinary
//! generic machinery against a [`ForeignHostAllocator`](crate::registry::ForeignHostAllocator)
//! over the target's live host, selected per-annotation by the generated field code;
//! `#[bstack_ref]` aliases (byte-copied, owns nothing). Construction, nullability
//! (`Option<Foreign<T>>`, `offset == 0` niche), and resolution are here.
//!
//! **Cross-file atomicity is best-effort**, and inherently so: two independent
//! bstack files have no shared commit, so a deep clone / teardown that spans the home
//! file and a foreign file cannot be one atomic unit. Each *file's own* commit is
//! atomic (the foreign side runs its own crash-safe `try_clone_in` / teardown through
//! the adapter), and the ordering always errs toward **over-provisioning** — an
//! orphaned fresh block or an over-count, which leaks — never toward an under-count
//! (a premature free / double-free). A target file not attached at the time makes an
//! owning clone *error* rather than silently alias.

// of the foreign host) for a cross-file one. Because the whole teardown machinery

// `__bstack_drop_children` they call) is generic over `A: BStackRaiiAllocator`, the
// same code frees the target in its own file with no duplication — reads/writes go
// through `alloc.stack()`, and frees are tagged with `alloc.wal_file_id()` so the
// home WAL reclaims them in the right file. The generated `Foreign` field teardown
// picks the helper by the field's annotation. `#[bstack_ref]` has no helper (a

// **Atomicity across files is best-effort (option-1):** the foreign side is touched

// leaks, never toward an under-count (which would be a premature free / double-free).
