//! Process-wide registry of bstack files — the stateful foundation for
//! `Foreign<T>` (cross-file pointers), built before `Foreign<T>` itself.
//!
//! A `Foreign<T>` is "a slice with a file identity attached": a [`FileId`] plus a
//! [`BStackRange`]. Paths are variable-length and awkward to embed on disk, so the
//! registry maps each file's **persistent path** to a small, **stable** numeric
//! [`FileId`] that a `Foreign` can store as a plain integer. Resolving that id
//! back to the file's live allocator (to read/write/allocate in it) happens here.
//!
//! ## Two layers
//!
//! * **Persistent** — a dedicated bstack file (its own [`FirstFitBStackAllocator`])
//!   holding the **append-only** path table. Ids are just indices into it, so a
//!   `Foreign` written to disk with `FileId(5)` means the same path on every future
//!   run. Paths are *never removed* (that would renumber ids and dangle stored
//!   `Foreign`s); only appended.
//! * **In-memory** — mirrors the path↔id maps and adds `id -> live host`: the
//!   *open* allocator for a file, type-erased behind [`ForeignHost`]. Guarded by a
//!   [`parking_lot::RwLock`].
//!
//! ## Why an `RwLock` (and why `parking_lot`)
//!
//! Resolving a foreign file to run an op on it is **hot** and concurrent (many
//! readers); *detaching* a live file is **cold** and must not race an in-flight op
//! (an exclusive writer). That is exactly a read-write lock — and since the read
//! side sits on the bstack io hot path, [`parking_lot::RwLock`] (cheaper, no
//! poisoning) is preferred over `std`. [`FileRegistry::with_host`] holds the read
//! lock for the whole duration of the caller's closure, so a concurrent
//! [`detach`](FileRegistry::detach) blocks until the op finishes — the "stop
//! token" that keeps a live file from vanishing mid-operation.
//!
//! ## Optional and zero-cost when unused
//!
//! The registry is a lazily-created global: a program that never registers a file
//! never instantiates it, so ordinary single-file ops pay nothing. It is brought
//! up explicitly with [`init`].
